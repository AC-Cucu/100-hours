# MERN Crash Course Project 01: Product Store

This project is the first of 23 in the "100 Hours of MERN" series. The goal is to build a full-featured product store using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Progress

- **Frontend:** Coming soon

Stay tuned as we continue building out the frontend and integrate it with the backend API.
